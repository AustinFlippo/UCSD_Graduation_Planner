# Course Data v5 - Merge Summary

## What v5 Contains

v5.json is the **definitive course data file** that combines:

- **Base Data**: All course information from v4.json (correct descriptions, prerequisites, offerings, etc.)
- **Credit Information**: Accurate credit/unit values from v3.json

## Merge Statistics

- **Total Courses**: 7333
- **Credits Updated**: 7333 courses got credit info from v3
- **Credits Missing**: 0 courses kept v4's credit values
- **Source Files**: v3.json (7334 courses) + v4.json (7333 courses)

## Data Quality

✅ **Complete Information**: Correct course descriptions, prerequisites, and offerings from v4  
✅ **Accurate Credits**: Proper unit/credit values from v3  
✅ **Consistent Structure**: Maintains v4's improved data structure  
✅ **No Data Loss**: All courses from v4 are preserved  

## Key Improvements in v5

### From v4 (Base):
- Comprehensive course descriptions
- Accurate prerequisites information
- Proper course offerings (FA, WI, SP)
- Professor information where available
- Normalized course IDs for searching

### From v3 (Credits):
- Actual numeric credit values (1, 2, 4, etc.)
- Replaces v4's "N/A" credit placeholders
- Maintains special cases like "N/A" for internships/variable credit courses

## Structure Example

```json
{
  "normalized_course_id": "aas10",
  "course_id": "AAS 10", 
  "course_name": "Introduction to African American Studies",
  "description": "Comprehensive course description...",
  "credits": "4",  // ← This comes from v3
  "prerequisites": "None",  // ← This comes from v4
  "offerings": ["FA", "WI", "SP"],  // ← This comes from v4
  "professors": [...]  // ← This comes from v4
}
```

## Usage Instructions
